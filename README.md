# Basic-Database

This is a Basic Database built in python3.4 - 64bit.
I made this datbase in my spare time because i was bored.

This database will allow you to:
1.Add a new files
2.Delete existing files
3.Search a file
4.Add data to existing files
5.Ask questions and it will fetch what you are looking for.

Notice:
It does NOT have a GUI.
You are able to interract with it through IDLE or Command Line.
Your files are saved in the directory where the program is saved in a .txt format.
