# Basic-Database

This is a Basic Database built in python3.4 - 64bit.
I made this datbase in my spare time because i was bored.

This database will allow you to:
1.Add a new files
2.Delete existing files
3.Search a file
4.Add data to existing files
5.Ask questions and it will fetch what you are looking for.

Initally it didn't have all these features but then i improved it gradually; adding more function over time.
I will upload the oldest version and then add more functions to it so everyone knows how i changed it over time. 

Notice:
I am NEW to GITHUB
It does NOT have a GUI.
You are able to interract with it through IDLE or Command Line.
Your files are saved in the directory where the program is saved in a .txt format. 

Lastly, if there is anything wrong with my code or if you would like to give me feedback then please leave a comment.
