# Basic-Database

UPDATE:
I have added another file (GUI.py) which creates
a simple Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the
database. I will continue to improve it over time.

This is a Basic Database built in python3.4 - 64bit.
I made this datbase in my spare time because i was bored.

HOW TO USE GUI:
1.Select the option you want to preceed with (e.g. Add new files)
2.Enter the input into the area provided
3.Click Submit
4.You will see the output on the IDLE or command line depending
on where you run the program.

This database will allow you to:
1.Add a new files
2.Delete existing files
3.Search a file
4.Add data to existing files
5.Ask questions and it will fetch what you are looking for.

Initally it didn't have all these features but then i improved it gradually; adding more function over time.
I will upload the oldest version and then add more functions to it so everyone knows how i changed it over time. 

Notice:
I am NEW to GITHUB.
You are able to interract with it throuh GUI and IDLE or Command Line.
Your files are saved in the directory where the program is saved in a .txt format. 

Lastly, if there is anything wrong with my code or if you would like to give me feedback then please leave a comment.
